        PLEASE NOTE: there is endless possibilities, you can for example have just a simple js to change the iframe src link to real session (to hide), the other way around by appending the source below instead.

        After the game iniatilized, the url can be changed back to bgaming, while it is still working on our api (after init connection)
        
        // AUTH //
        No need for sentry at all, no need for posting etc. etc. - frontend still is hosted completely by the provider, auto updated.

        The auth can be 1:1 based like provider, that means we simply put the session id to the player id, can use provider origin session, so you can easily check back games in back office @ provider.

        Auth in this case is based on laravel (<3) but ofc can be any, don't need any posts or whatever the fuck with sentry or seperating the auth at all - as any reputable provider will have their session system setup properly we just use their session id system.

        Example can be found at: www.cherry.games - where I changed origin bgaming slots in exact same fashion, but with a custom rebrandment
